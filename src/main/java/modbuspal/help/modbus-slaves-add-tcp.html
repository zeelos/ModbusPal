      <h1>Adding MODBUS TCP slaves</h1>

      <h2>Regular MODBUS TCP addressing</h2>
      
      <p>When a single MODBUS TCP device has its own IP address on the network,
      then the IP address is self sufficient to identify that slave.</p>

      <p>New MODBUS TCP slaves can be created by using one of the
      following patterns:</p>
      
      <dl>
          <dt>127.0.0.1</dt>
          <dd>Create just one slave that will reply to requests received
              from any network interface.</dd>
          <dt>192.168.10.100</dt>
          <dd>Create just one slave that will only reply to requests received
              on the network interface whose IP address is 192.168.10.100.</dd>
          <dt>10.23.6.2, 10.23.6.8 (not implemented)</dt>
          <dd>Create 2 slaves that will reply to requests received
              on network interfaces whose IP addresses are 10.23.6.2,
              and 10.23.6.8.</dd>
          <dt>10.23.6.2-10.23.6.8 (not implemented)</dt>
          <dd>Create 9 slaves that will reply to requests received
              on network interfaces whose IP addresses are 10.23.6.2,
              10.23.6.3, ..., 10.23.6.7 and 10.23.6.8.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <p>Note: the comma can be replaced by a new line. White 
      spaces following the comma are ignored.</p>

      <h2>Multiple slaves sharing the same IP address</h2>
      
      <p>When more than one MODBUS TCP device share the same IP address on the network,
      then the IP address alone is not sufficient to identify each slave. This is
      the case when, for example, the IP address is owned by a TCP/SERIAL gateway
      and the actual MODBUS slaves are using MODBUS RTU protocol.</p>

      <p>Such MODBUS slaves must be identified by both an IP address and a slave
      number, and can be created by using one of the
      following patterns:</p>
      
      <dl>
          <dt>127.0.0.1(17) (not implemented)</dt>
          <dd>Create juste one slave at IP address 127.0.0.1 (listen on all
          network interfaces) and slave number 17.</dd>
          <dt>192.168.10.100(10-15) (not implemented)</dt>
          <dd>Create 6 slaves sharing the same IP address (local network interface
          192.168.10.100). Each slave is assigned a slave number ranging from 10
          to 15 included.</dd>
      </dl>
